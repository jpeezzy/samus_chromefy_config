# samus_chromefy_config
Configuration for samus users running chromefy. Ideally you use an Eve installation with a caroline bin. This file should have a shell script to run once and the configuration will be complete. Run `sudo bash script.sh` and it will automatically fix some issues that happen when running a samus chromebook on chromefy
